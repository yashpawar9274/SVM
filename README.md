# Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### 📌 Objective
- Train and evaluate SVM for linear & non-linear classification.
- Learn kernel trick, margin maximization, hyperparameter tuning.

### 🔧 Tools
- Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib

### 🚀 Steps
1. Loaded Breast Cancer dataset (binary classification).
2. Trained Linear SVM & RBF Kernel SVM.
3. Tuned hyperparameters (C, gamma).
4. Visualized decision boundaries on synthetic dataset.
5. Evaluated using cross-validation.

### 📊 Results
- Linear SVM Accuracy: ~96%
- RBF SVM Accuracy: ~98%
- Cross-validation Accuracy: ~97%
